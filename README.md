# -Car-Prediction

Description:
The car price prediction tool allows users to input various car specifications, including attributes such as the car's maximum power (BHP), manufacturing year, fuel type, and brand. This input is used to determine the most accurate estimated selling price of the car. Our tool employs a Random Forest Regressor model with a 93% accuracy score for making these predictions.

How to use:
To utilize this tool, follow these steps:

Install the following extensions in your Visual Studio Code: Docker and Remote Explorer.
Open the primary directory of 'Car-Price-Prediction' using Visual Studio Code.
Inside the 'app' folder, locate the 'docker-compose.yaml' file. Right-click on this file and choose 'Compose Up,' then wait for the setup process to complete.
Switch to the Docker view within your VS Code and right-click on the 'app:latest' image found in the 'app' container. Select 'Attach Visual Studio Code,' which will open a new VS Code window.
Finally, execute the 'main.py' script found in the '/root/code' folder. This will launch the car price prediction application.
